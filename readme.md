#Thinkful Unit 1 Challenge

Source files are inside _site_ folder. Please view full product at the [github io page](http://cyborgspider.github.io/thinkful-adder-subtracter).

##JavaScript
**scripts.js**

This could stand to improve greatly, with additional modules and more concise code. __The page uses this file, not a minified or CoffeeScript version.__

**scripts-coffee.coffee**

Because my job uses CoffeeScript and I want to get better at that too. There may be some caveats and best/bad practices I should identify from the get-go.

##CSS
**styles.styl**

I use Stylus for my pre-processor. Sass is too mainstream :p

#HTML
**index.jade**

An elegant templating language focused on quick HTML coding. Because I'm done with closing tags and less than/greater than symbols.
