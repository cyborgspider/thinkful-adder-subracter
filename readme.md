#Thinkful Unit 1 Challenge

Source files are inside _site_ folder. Please view full product at the [github io page](http://cyborgspider.github.io/thinkful-adder-subtracter).

##JavaScript
**scripts-old.js**

My first stab at the code, using an old-school function declaration, no comments. It worked but I knew I could do better (I hope).

**scripts.js**

A different approach, using an object literal for function declaration. I think it's a step in the right direction but could stand to improve greatly, with additional modules and more concise code. __This is the file index.html uses.__

**scripts-coffee.coffee**

Because my job uses CoffeeScript and I want to get better at that too. There may be some caveats and best/bad practices I should identify from the get-go.

##CSS
**styles.styl**

I use Stylus for my pre-processor. Sass is too mainstream :p

#HTML
**index.jade**

An elegant templating language focused on quick HTML coding. Because I'm done with closing tags and less than/greater than symbols.
